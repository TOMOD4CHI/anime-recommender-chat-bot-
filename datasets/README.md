The data used in this project is stored in the `datasets/` directory.
It includes various datasets related to anime, user preferences, and other relevant information that the chatbot and recommender system utilize to provide accurate and personalized recommendations.
*Note: the user rating data is excluded due heavy size (can be found in the original kaggle dataset).*
